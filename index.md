# Research
Currently, I am involved in a research project of Medical Image Segmentation and NLP with the help of Deep Learning.

#### 3D Brain Tumor Segmentation of MR Images 
- Segmentation of brain tumor from MRI considering 3D volume.
- The dataset used in the project is BraTS(2018-19) which contains 3D images of glioma brain tumor.

#### Denoising Autoencoder using GAN
- Denoising of noisy MNIST dataset and 2-D Brain image dataset containing different types and variations of noises.
- Model used was Stacked Sparse Denoising Autoencoder.
- GAN was used for further improve the quality of images.

#### Object Identification
- Implemented YOLO v2/v3 on detecting a custom objects.
- Also worked on Retinanet (RESNET50) on the same.
- Currently trying the same on Satellite images.
#### Multi-organ Segmentation
- Performed multi-organ segmentation on 8 organs of the human body.
- The organs included the pancreas, three organs fronm gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach and duodenum), liver, gallbladder, spleen and left kidney.

#### Type-2 Diabetes
- Worked on triopathy of diabetes i.e. Nephropathy, Neuropathy and Retinopathy.  
- This project was in collaboration with Diacare Diabetes center. The data contained real city patients with 373+ attributes of all complications of Diabetes. 
- The model will work like an assistant to the doctor which would help in diagnosis of Nephropathy mainly.

# Other Projects

#### Basic Personal Assistant without AI
- A system which assist a person according to his/her schedule.
- Worked with HTML and MySQL database.

#### Qr code and Fund Transfer
- Worked with java and created a code for generating QR Code and reading a QR code
- Also Xampp database which was connected with java and perform transection operation on database.
